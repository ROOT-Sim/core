We are proud to announce the release of ROOT-Sim version 3.0.0!

This release brings a complete rewrite from scratch in C11 of the whole runtime. Several advancements come along with this rewrite:

* A new build system (meson) is used
* Several legacy features have been removed to improve performance
* Native assembly code has been fully removed, moving the codebase to C11: we are building already on x86 and ARM machines
* The codebase is more portable: we build on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

Some of the older features will be slowly reintegrated in the release.
