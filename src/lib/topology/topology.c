/**
 * @brief Given a linear id in a TOPOLOGY_HEXAGON map, get the linear id of a neighbor in a given direction (if any).
 *
 * We use only one possible representation of a hexagonal map, namely a "pointy" "odd-r" horizontal layout,
 * with an arbitrary width and height. In this representation, odd rows are showed right:
 *
 *   / \ / \ / \ / \
 *  |0,0|1,0|2,0|3,0|
 *   \ / \ / \ / \ / \
 *    |0,1|1,1|2,1|3,1|
 *   / \ / \ / \ / \ /
 *  |0,2|1,2|2,2|3,2|
 *   \ / \ / \ / \ /
 *
 *  This is a map of size 3x4, in which 12 different cells are represented. In each hexagon, the (x,y)
 *  coordinates are represented. Nevertheless, to support simulation, we typically linearize the cells of
 *  the map. Indeed, the cells are linearly mapped as:
 *  0 → (0,0); 1 → (1,0); 2 → (2,0); 3 → (3,0); 4 → (0,1); 5 → (1,1); 6 → (2,1); 7 → (3,1); etc.
 *
 *  The general mapping from linear (L) to hex (x,y) is therefore implemented as (in integer arithmetic):
 *  y = L / width
 *  x = L % width
 *
 *  while the mapping from (x,y) to L is implemented as:
 *
 *  L = y * width + x
 *
 *  When checking for a neighbor, we have to consider the row in which we are starting from. Indeed, considering
 *  that it's an "odd-r" map, if we are in an odd row and we move "up left" or "down left", we retain the same x
 *  value. Conversely, if we move from an odd row "up right" or "down right", we have to increment x. Moving from
 *  an even row is the other way round (retain x if you move up/down right, decrement if you move up/down left).
 *  In this implementation, we use bitwise and with 1 to check if we are in an odd row.
 *  Moving up/down always decrements/increments y. Moving right/left only increments/decrements x.
 *
 *  At the end, to check if a move is valid, we compare new coordinates (x,y) with the size of the grid.
 *
 *
 * @param from      The linear representation of the source element
 * @param topology  The structure keeping the information about the topology
 * @param direction The direction to move towards, to find a linear id
 * @return The linear id of the neighbor, INVALID_DIRECTION if such neighbor does not exist in the topology.
