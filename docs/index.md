# ROOT-Sim core documentation

The continuous integration service of ROOT-Sim automatically rebuilds the internal documentation every time
that a development version or a stable version is released.

We release a stable version seldom, after a significant correctness and performance tests have been carried out.
Therefore, we provide here links to both versions of the documentation, as they can be significantly different.

* [Stable version documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/master/). ![doc coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Froot-sim.github.io%2Fcore%2Fdocs%2Fmaster.json)
* [Development version documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/develop/). ![doc coverage](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Froot-sim.github.io%2Fcore%2Fdocs%2Fdevelop.json)
